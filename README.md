this is the user level config I use on my NixOS laptop. If you want to try it out you should be able to clone it into your `.config/nixpkgs` folder, [install home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager#installation) and run `home-manager switch` to try it out. There is also some system level configuration that needs to be done to set xmonad as your window manager, which is not shown here.

# To-do
- start ibus daemon automatically
- add ibus indicator on polybar
- add wifi indicator on polybar
- make xmonad prettier
- write an actually good gtk theme
- bind brightness keys
- get multiple monitors working again (I think this broke when I switched to desktopConfig)
